This project aims to demonstrate how to perform end-to-end (E2E) testing using Cypress and run these tests on GitHub Actions. E2E testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and functionality of web applications.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow file `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` contains the configuration for running E2E tests on GitHub Actions. It triggers the workflow on every push to the repository.
